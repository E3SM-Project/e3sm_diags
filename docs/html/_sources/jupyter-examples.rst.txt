Jupyter notebook examples
=========================

Examples of additional ACME Diags functionality documented using Jupyter 
notebooks.

Model-vs-model comparison
-------------------------

In addition to the standard model-vs-obs comparison plots, ACME Diags can also generate
model-vs-model comparison plots:

`Model-vs-model notebook 
<https://github.com/ACME-Climate/acme_diags/tree/master/examples/model-vs-model/model-vs-model.ipynb>`_

Obs-vs-obs comparison
---------------------

Curious to see differences between two different observational datasets?
ACME Diags can do this as well:

`Obs-vs-obs notebook 
<https://github.com/ACME-Climate/acme_diags/tree/master/examples/odel-vs-obs/obs-vs-obs.ipynb>`_
