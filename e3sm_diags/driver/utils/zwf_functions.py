    Method
    ------
        1. Subsample in latitude if latitude_bounds is specified.
        2. Detrend the data (but keeps the mean value, as in NCL)
        3. High-pass filter if rmvLowFrq is True
        4. Construct symmetric/antisymmetric array if dosymmetries is True.
        5. Construct overlapping window view of data.
        6. Detrend the segments (strange enough, removing mean).
        7. Apply taper in time dimension of windows (aka segments).
        8. Fourier transform
        9. Apply Hayashi reordering to get propagation direction & convert to power.
       10. return DataArray with power.

    Notes
    -----
        Upon returning power, this should be comparable to "raw" spectra.
        Next step would be be to smooth with `smooth_wavefreq`,
        and divide raw spectra by smooth background to obtain "significant" spectral power.
